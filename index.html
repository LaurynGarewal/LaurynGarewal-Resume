        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Lauryn Garewal. I am a twenty year old Junior at the University of California Riverside. I am currently a psychology major and plan to get a bachelors of art diploma in this department. I currently have a cumulative grade point average of 3.6 and plan to only increase in my last couple of quarters. I am on track to graduate in winter of 2023.I am a student athlete at UCR as well, on the softball team. I am a three year starting second baseman for the team, and have been fortunate enough to have a great coaching staff that has led me to successful seasons. Being a student athlete is hard, it's very time consuming and a true challenge. It has made me learn how to efficiently manage my time, as we practice every day for around five hours, I have to plan out my days accordingly to manage softball and keep up with my good grades. I am also a manager at Nutrishop in Beaumont California. Meaning that I have a background in sales and the background of how a business works. I plan on keeping this job as it is my only source of stable income, but I plan on going to school after I graduate from UCR. I also have a background in customer service as I have worked for the Starbucks company as a barista in the past for about a year. This job led me to learn excellent time management, cleanliness, and how to handle customers well. Working in the food industry has taught me a multitude of skills that I have carried along with me through my daily life. I also help out in my community by coaching and umpiring the little league softball and baseball teams since I was in the seventh grade. I was a volunteer for three years of coaching, then I was able to umpire and get paid for another three years, but I still ran free clinics for the teams. Softball has been and will always be a big part of my life which has led me to learn a great deal of team management and how to be a good team member. I have played softball since I was eight years old. That is why I like to volunteer my time and umpire in my home town because that is where it all started for me. I am forever grateful for the opportunities that I have received. When I am not playing softball or working, I love to go to the beach to unwind and relax, it is one of my favorite pastimes. One of my favorite things to do at the beach is look for sea animals under the pier. As well I am a big family girl, whenever I can i like to go home and have a nice home cooked meal with my family and spend time together. We also go camping in the desert and ride quads. We have done that since I was a little girl. I spend a lot of time with my sister, who I live in an apartment with in Riverside. She is one of my biggest role models as she has already graduated from UCR. <br><br>
